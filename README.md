## Project Description:
A computer vision approach to classifying garbage into recycling categories could be an efficient way to process waste. Recycling is already significant work for all countries. Among the work needed for recycling, garbage classification is the most fundamental step to enable cost-efficient recycling. This project aims to take images of a single piece of recycling or garbage and classify it into one out of six classes consisting of glass, paper, metal, plastic, cardboard, and trash.
